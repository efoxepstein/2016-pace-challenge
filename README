This project implements two heuristics for finding tree decompositions:

  (1) Minimum Degree: this algorithm selects the vertex v of minimum degree,
                      adds edges to turn its neighborhood into a clique,
                      recurses on the graph resulting from deleting v,
                      then adds a bag containing v and its neighbors.

  (2) Minimum Fill-In: this algorithm operates identically to Minimum Degree,
                       except it greedily picks a vertex whose neighborhood's
                       complement is edge-minimal.

To build, run:
  $ make

This produces 2 executables:

  (1) bin/td-validate: a non-throwing version of the provided validation script
  (2) bin/tw-heuristic: an executable that tries both heuristics on the provided
                        graph and outputs the better of the two
