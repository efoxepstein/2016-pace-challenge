This is a submission for Track A (Tree Width) of the the 2016 PACE challenge:

  https://pacechallenge.wordpress.com/track-a-treewidth/

This project implements the Minimum Degree heuristic for finding tree
decompositions.  This algorithm selects the vertex v of minimum degree, adds
edges to turn its neighborhood into a clique, recurses on the graph resulting
from deleting v, then adds a bag containing v and its neighbors.

To build, run:

  $ make

This produces the executable bin/tw-heuristic that operates as specified by the
challenge website.
