This project implements two simple heuristics for finding tree
decompositions:

  Minimum Degree: this algorithm selects the vertex v of minimum
  degree, adds edges to turn its neighborhood into a clique,
  recurses on the graph resulting from deleting v, then adds a bag
  containing v and its neighbors.

  Minimum Fill-In: this algorithm operates identically to Minimum
  Degree, except it greedily picks a vertex whose neighborhood's
  complement is edge-minimal.

To build, run: $ make

This produces 2 executables:

  bin/td-validate: a non-throwing version of the provided validation
  script
  
  bin/tw-heuristic: an executable that tries both heuristics on the
  provided graph and outputs the better of the two.
